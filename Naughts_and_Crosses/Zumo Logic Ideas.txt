+ start with if statement fed from processing that decides which team (i.e which zumo)
  is in play.

+ have previous player's turn (if not first go) recorded in system elsewhere, either
  after go or recorded in gui where last turn took place. could use GUI to track this or
  use logic elsewhere to track this (latter probably easiest)

+ case statement that records direction where zumo is currently facing (NSEW), given 
  from last go.

+ player chooses go and based on coordinates of current zumo pos and where it needs 
  to go, goes through list of if statements that decide decrements/turns etc

eg. zumo has to go from top left to bottom right
	
if (zumo is facing west) {
	if (pos = coord(1.1) {
		switch (destination = [3.3]) { 
			rotate 90 degrees;
			rotate 90 degrees;
			set decrement counter to 2;
			execute(); (function to move zumo over lines and decrement until
			counter runs out)
			rotate 90 degrees right to face south;
			set decrememt counter to 2;
			execute();
			//end of go
		}
	}
}

+ within the execute() function, after each grey line is crossed, which will be read by
  the sensors on the bottom, a room will be scanned by the ultrasonic scanner to check
  for another zumo, if one is found then params and other stuff will be passed over, 
  and the main if statement will start again but with updated coordinates to go from and
  the original destination coordinate. If a black line is read the zumo stops straight
  away and either changes direction to finish journey or it's destination is reached.
  This then evokes a short reverse to make sure the zumo isn't stuck on the black line.

+ The definition between grey and black lines will be read by the bottom sensors on 
  the zumo...

if ((sensor.reading >= 0) && (sensor.reading <= 100)) {
	print("black line");
	decrement 1;	// ??????
	shortReverse();
} else if ((sensor.reading >= 101) && (sensor.reading <= 250)) {
	print("grey line");
	decrement 1;
	scanRoom();
	carryOnInnit();
} else {
	if (decrementCounter = 0) {
		nudge to middle;
	} else {
		carry on forward;
	}
	// move forward to next line unless counter has decremented to zero, if so then
	nudge to middle of square and record end of go...
}
